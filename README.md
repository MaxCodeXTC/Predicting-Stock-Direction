# Predicting-Stock-Direction
Predicting the 'direction' of stocks using historical data

<br/>In this repository, instead of predicting the price of the stock directly, effort has been made to predict its _direction_ instead. Definitely a statistically more sound approach.  
The results are however pretty bad due to absence of Feature Engineering. Feature Engineering will be tackled later on.  
For the time being the repository will continue to be in development with more and more sophisticated methods in creating model ensembles.
